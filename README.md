C= BASIC Many DOS Disk content show/edit

I got this idea from the many BAM readers and Sector Editors for the C=64.
I fould that most of them were for a specific drive trpe like the vanilla 1541 or the 1581.
I was interested in seeing the BAM and sectors on my CMD 3.5 floppy.
I found that there were ways to see the emulated partitions on the CMD and the RAW formats as well.
I want to create a BAM/Sector Display/Editor that will be able to not only work on the 1541.
Goals:
Be able to identify and read from any connected device either IEC or IEEE488

Try and make the code portable to as many C= computers as possible
